    <p>We first need to take a look at the sentiment analysis score of each tweet to see if the score are satisfactory. We did not obtain the best results but they are still workable.</p>

<h2 id="gathering-the-weather-forecast">Gathering the weather forecast</h2>

<p>Getting the weather forecast, even though it is possible to do so for every city, the task is a bit tedious so we choose the 5 biggest cities in our dataset representing the 20% of the data points or around a million tweets. We also naively filtered bots by removing the tweets that appeared at zero seconds, it would also take away 1/60 of our data which is negligeable and it doesn’t affect our results, provided that it is a completely random sample. 200 thousand tweets were filtered leaving us with 800 thousand.
Graphing the remaining tweets we see that most of them are concentrated in winter 2010. We might have to leave some periods out.</p>

<h3 id="number-of-tweets-h3-title">Number of tweets (H3 title):</h3>
<p><img src="assets/plot_nr_of_tweets.png" alt="Number of tweets" /></p>

<p>The first thing we’re going to find is the standard deviation of positive and negative sentiments from one day to another. We expect it to follow a normal distribution centered around zero.</p>

<p>Indeed we find a bell shaped curve.</p>
