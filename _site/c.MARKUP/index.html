    <p>We want to know if the weather has an effect on this curve, shifting it to the right during good weather and to the left during bad weather. In order to do that a first metric would be to look at rainy days days and plot the new mood standard deviation.</p>

<h3 id="mood-on-rainy-days">Mood on rainy days:</h3>
<p><img src="assets/rainy_days.png" alt="Weekly tweets" /></p>

<p>We do observe a shift, but is it enough to conclude that it was the effect of the weather ?</p>

<p>The t value is not sufficient so we can’t reject the hypothesis that which weather has an effect. But maybe it is not the weather that directly influences the mood but its variation, so we define a metric of changing weather which is the weather value of the day minus the one for the previous day. Instead of looking at every possible variation we will look at extremes ones. Here are the result:</p>

<h3 id="effect-of-extreme-weather-variations">Effect of extreme weather variations:</h3>

<p>We find 45 days with sudden weather change. We again observe a shift in the normal distribution. Is it more relevant than before ?</p>

<p>We still can’t reject the null hypothesis.</p>

<p>Is it possible to reduce the variation of other measurable sources, does the sentiment analysis give different results for each day of the week ? And if yes, can we take it into account in our statistical journey.
We plot the average sentiment variation on the course of the week:</p>

<h3 id="tweet-sentiment-over-the-course-of-the-week">Tweet sentiment over the course of the week:</h3>
<p><img src="assets/tweets_over_week.png" alt="Weekly tweets" /></p>

<p>The sentiments seems stable during the week so the day is not affecting the sentiments of our dataset</p>
