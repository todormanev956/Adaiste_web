To answer this question we looked at a dataset of 5 million tweet found on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/twitter_cikm_2010).
We performed sentiment analysis and classified each tweet as positive, negative or neutral. This way, we wouldâ€™t know how much exactly the weather affects us,but just whether it does. We computed the variation in proportion of positively and negatively classified tweets from day to day. Postulating that the general mood for a given day was influenced by the previous day. Our null hypothesis is that the weather does not affect the mood of people.
