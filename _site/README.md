# Food Map

## Abstract
What would you like to eat today? We pose ourselves this question every day and we have a huge number of food options from different countries. We would like to analyse the different types of cuisines with respect to their nutritional values and their CO2 impact. This would allow us to create a food map of different parameters and compare the different cuisines in the world. The insight into this question could possibly change our habits.

## Research questions
* How can we separate the multitude of dishes in different clusters, integrating their cultural origins?
* What characteristics stand out in different clusters (e.g. nutritional value, carbon footprint)?
* What tendencies do these characteristics follow and in what ways are they correlated?
* Can we classify the clusters in hierarchical manner?

## Datasets
* Cooking recipes
* Recipe 1M+
* Open Food Facts Database

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
1. Organize and combine the different datasets; find the information available for all elements and clean the data. - week 1
2. Decide upon which criteria the recipes can be clustered and classified. - week 2
3. Perform a fist analysis of the results of the different types of clustering and focus on the ones giving the most pertinent and interesting information - week 3
4. Decide which tendencies across different criteria could be statistically significant - week 3
5. Think about different types of visualizations that can highlight our findings - week 3
6. Clean and present the intermediary notebook - week 4


## Questions for TAa
* Should we only focus on one of the recipe datasets?
* How can we find information about the origin of a dish if it is missing from the original datasets?
* Should we cluster the recipes based on their origin or based on their characteristics?
